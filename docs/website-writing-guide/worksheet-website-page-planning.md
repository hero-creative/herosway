[View Worksheet in Google Docs](https://google.com)

## 1. Purpose and Goals: 
Define the main purpose of the website and its goals. What do you want to achieve with this website? (e.g., showcase products, provide information, generate leads, sell services, etc.) 

## 2. Target Audience: 
Describe your ideal website visitors. Who are they? What are their needs and preferences? 

## 3. Core Pages: 

Identify the essential pages that your website should include: 

- Home 
- About Us / About Me 
- Services / Products
    - Individual Service (might be needed if there are many parts of a service item that cannot be all described onto one page)
- Contact Us / Contact Me 


## 4. Additional Pages: 
Brainstorm other pages that might be relevant to your website: 

- Portfolio / Gallery 
- Testimonials 
- Blog 
- FAQ 
- Pricing 
- Resources / Downloads 
- Terms and Conditions 
- Privacy Policy 

## 5. Navigation: 
Map out how your website's navigation menu will be organized. Indicate which pages will appear in the main menu and which might be in sub-menus. 

## 6. Page Hierarchy: 
Determine if there are any parent-child relationships between pages (e.g., a sub-page under a main service page). 

## 7. Call-to-Action (CTA): 
Identify the primary action you want visitors to take on each page. This could be signing up for a newsletter, contacting you, making a purchase, etc. 

## 8. Content for Each Page: 
For each identified page, briefly outline the content you plan to include. This can be a short description of the information or elements you want to showcase. 

## 9. Page Interactivity: 
Do any pages require interactive elements like forms, surveys, quizzes, or a search bar?
